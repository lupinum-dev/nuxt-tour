# Maintaining Nuxt Tour

## Design phase

The package is not published. Change the design specification before or with a
public API implementation. State the user journey and acceptance criterion for
each new option, export, event, or state value. Prefer a hard cutover while no
users or persisted data depend on the old design.

Do not present a proposed API as implemented behavior. Remove the design-phase
warning only after the quick-start journey works from the packed package.

## Quick fix

Create a focused branch. Add a regression test. Run `pnpm verify`. Open a pull request with the result, verification, release note, and risk.

## Large change

Open an issue first. Record important architecture decisions. Split work at the
contract, runtime, rendering, Nuxt integration, and browser-verification
boundaries when each part can be reviewed independently. Keep migrations
explicit and remove temporary compatibility code after the cutover.

## Dependency update

Use Renovate for routine updates. Review release notes and lockfile changes. Do not bypass the 24-hour quarantine. Run `pnpm audit:all` and `pnpm verify`.

## Documentation change

Follow [docs/WRITING.md](docs/WRITING.md). Run `pnpm docs:build`. Verify links, mobile navigation, search, analytics, and feedback on the deployed preview.

Vercel uses `docs/` as the Root Directory. Enable source files outside the Root
Directory because the documentation build needs this workspace package. Keep
`vercel.json` in `docs/`.

## First npm release

The package must exist before npm can bind a trusted publisher. Download the exact tarball from the successful main CI release-candidate artifact and verify its SHA-256. Publish that same file once with 2FA, `--access public`, the correct dist-tag, and `--ignore-scripts`. Then bind `publish.yml` and environment `npm` as the trusted publisher. Dispatch `publish.yml` for the same version. It derives bootstrap state only when the registry bytes match and this is the sole published version. It records the exception in the GitHub release. Never rebuild the artifact or provide a bootstrap switch.

## Normal release

Update `CHANGELOG.md` with `pnpm release:prepare` in a focused pull request. Merge after `pnpm release:verify` and CI pass. Dispatch `publish.yml` from current `main` with the reviewed package version. The workflow derives every other value from exact successful `main` CI. It requests npm approval only when publication is required and repairs the tag or GitHub release separately.

## Rollback

Do not delete a published version. Deprecate a broken version, restore the last good code in a new pull request, and publish a patch. Move the dist-tag only when users need an immediate safe version.

## Credential incident

Stop releases. Revoke the affected credential or trusted publisher. Review audit logs and published bytes. Do not commit replacement secrets. Restore trusted publishing only after the repository and account are safe.
